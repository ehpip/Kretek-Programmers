// We can work with promises in an easier way by using async and await.
//"async" before a function means that the function will always returns a promise.
//"await" waits until the promise settles and return its result.
//await will only works inside the async functions

async function example1() {
  let promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 2000);
  });

  let result = await promise; //waits until the promise resolves
  console.log(result);
}

example1();

//So the above code will write done! to the console after 2s

//Error Handling
//If a promise resolves, then await promise will return the result . But in the case of a rejection, you have to handle the error
//You can use try catch for that
async function example2() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch("https://www.google.com/");
    console.log(response);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

example2();
//In the case of an error , the control jumps to the catch block.
